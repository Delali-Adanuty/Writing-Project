        <h3>My Aspirations at the beginning of the semester</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I did not have any clear cut expectations for how this class would go and as such I psyched myself for a wide variety of possible activities that could go on. I still ended up being surprised by some (if not most) of the projects we did.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the beginning of the semester, I was coming to the class hoping to just ‘write’ or talk about my thoughts on some subject matters and put that into writing.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have always been a “last-minute” person and it was something I hoped to do away with ( at least in relation to this class). I hoped to always be on top of my projects and assignments.
            </li>
            <li>
                My main aim before the class started was to develop my descriptive abilities as a writer. I always appreciated how seasoned writers could place you in vivid scenes with mere words and it was something I hoped to learn how to recreate.
            </li>
        </ul>
