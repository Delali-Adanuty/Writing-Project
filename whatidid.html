                Yes! I did a project on an episode of Blackish. And that's just one of the projects I worked on during the class. You'd definitely want to find out about the rest.

        <h3>What I did during the Semester</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first project I worked on this semester was a learning memoir and it was supposed to be a true life experience  . For a learning memoir, there is supposed to be a turning point, which brings about the learning experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            That was the roadblock for me. I found it difficult to single out an experience that led to a rapid change in my ideologies and I did not find any of my life activities interesting enough to write about as I consider my life pretty boring.
          </li>
          <li>
            The breakthrough for me was realizing small events could also make good stories and I ended up writing about my first twenty-four hours in high school (boarding school in my case)
          </li>
          <li>
            And yeah.. Blackish. That was for my Cultural Artifact project and I analyzed the thirteenth episode of the third season and it mainly talked about mental health prioritization in the black community. Though comedic, Blackish did a good job bringing the issues to light and analyzing it was exciting.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Disciplinary Literacies Project… My most challenging aspect of this project was the Informational Interview, but it ended up being very eye opening and interesting. I had the privilege to interview Jack Peurach, who had been a past CEO of Ekso Bionics. His advice about how to rise through the ranks from an entry level engineer to managerial roles in engineering firms is something that has stuck with me.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also analyzed a day in the life of an engineer video as part of this project. This gave me a sneak peek into the skills I would need to develop in the industry and what typical work days are going to be like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then there is the Visual Bibliography. I researched patent culture and its impact in the engineering industry: whether or not it was beneficial to the society as a whole. I came across a lot of different opinions which looked at the topic from different angles and its safe to say I’m still not sure which is which.
          </li>
        </ul>
