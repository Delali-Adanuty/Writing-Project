        <h3>Where do I go from here?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Something that was consistent throughout the peer reviews was my ability to convey the desired message and not steer off-course and that is something I would want to keep doing in my future writing projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                One thing I would like to change is my procrastination (with regards to writing). Iâ€™ve realized that the rare times I do not procrastinate, I write with much more freedom and end up producing better articles than when I am writing an hour to the deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                One thing I am trying to do to help me curb this is setting deadlines for myself that are twenty-four hours or more to the actual deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                From the data I gathered throughout the Disciplinary Literacies Project, the most common form of writing in my chosen field (engineering) is presentations and that would be something I would want to perfect. As one moves up the corporate ladder though, other forms of literature (research papers, press communications, and so on) come into play and I would arm myself with the necessary skills as I navigate the corporate world.
